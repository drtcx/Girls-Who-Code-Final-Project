  <h1> <head> What is police brutality? </head> </h1>

    <title></title>
    <h4> Police brutality is a form of police misconduct, where officers use excessive force. Excessive use of force is
      generally taken to mean force that was not necessary for that particular situation. Several  nations around the
      world have laws that address police brutality. The complaints about excessive use of force by police are not
      investigated and if they are, they usually say the officer acted appropriately.</h4>

  <h1> <head> How does police brutality effect the victims? </head> </h1>
  <h4> Victims may suffer physical harm, psychological damage and even fatality in extreme cases. Many
     victims of police brutality may suffer from PTSD, which is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Police brutality
     also have societal impacts, as citizens feel compelled to avoid police and they tend to lose faith that police
     officers are willing and able to provide them with protection.</h4>

     <h1> <head> When did a case of police brutality come about? </head> </h1>
     <h4> Two years ago a massive protests had erupted when Yanez killed Castile, after pulling
       him over for a broken taillight. Dashcam shows Yanez firing through open window, seconds
       after Castile disclosed that he owned and was licensed to carry a concealed weapon.
       After a jury acquitted a former police officer, Jeronimo Yanez of
       manslaughter in the shooting death of 32-year-old Philando Castile. Protesstors shut
       down Interstate 94 with signs that read: "Black Lives Matter" and "No Justice No Peace". The
       scene was familiar. Today, live streaming, tweets and Facebook posts have blasted the
        incidents of police brutality, beyond the black community and into the mainstream media.
         Philando's fiancee, Diamond Reynolds, who was in the car with her daughter when he
         was shot, streamed the immediate aftermath of the shooting on her phone using Facebook live.
