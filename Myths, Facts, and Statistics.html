<h1>Myths</h1>
<ul>
<li><h3>Undocumented people should just become legal.</h3></li>
It is not that easy to become a legal resident. The immigration system is a broken system. It is very slow and usually takes years to just become a legal permanent resident. (You can find more information at <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/why-legal-immigration-system-broken-short-list-problems">Cato Institute's website</a> or at <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/why-legal-immigration-system-broken-short-list-problems">United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' website</a>.)
</ul>

<h1>What You Did Not Know About Undocumented People</h1>
<ul>
<li><h3> Some people were left out from obtaining Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA)</h3></li>
The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program protects people brought to the United States illegally as children from being immediately deported if they are picked up by immigration officials. It also gave them the opportunity to access a bit more opportunities like being able to apply to jobs and live a more normal life with less restrictions.  You had to be at least 15 years old to apply, though. When Trump ended DACA, thousands of people were left out including those that could've applied in a few more years when they did turn 15.
