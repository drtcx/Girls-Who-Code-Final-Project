      <h1>What to do during Police Encounters</h1>
      <p> Getting stopped by the police can be a nerve recking experience becuase you never know
        what type of police you will encounter or how a routine traffic stop will end. Here's a list
      of action you should consider doing when by stopped by the police.</p><img src = "encounter.jpg" width="250" height="200" align = "middle">

      <h3> Be Respectful and Speak when Spoken to </h3>
      <p> Do not make the situation worst by being hostile towards the officer. Hostility will not solve the
        situation. Be respectful and speak when spoken and remain calm during the sitation. </p>

      <h3>Know Your Rights </h3>
      <p> You do not have to talk to the police nor allow them to search your vehicle if you feel uncomfortable.
        If you are under arrest make sure you are read your Miranda Rights. If you are unsure of what they are.
        Visit <a href="www.mirandawarning.org/whatareyourmirandarights.html">MirandaRights.org</a></p><img src = "rights.jpg" width="250" height="200" align = "middle">

      <h3> Keep Your Hands Visible </h3>
      <p> keep your hands on the steering wheel so that the officers have no reason to suspect anything. Before you reach for anything
        driver's license, insurence etc. make sure the officer(s) is fully aware of what you are doing. Also make sure the interior
        of your car is well lit to allow the officer(s) to see everything. </p><img src = "hands.jpg" width="250" height="200" align = "middle">


      <h3> Unsure of the Police officer is a real officer?</h3>
      <p> If you are unsure that the police officer is a real officer, ask for some identification or a badge number. But most of
        all if you feel like you are a victim of police brutality record the sitation with your phone and make sure you have evidence
        of the event. Also soon after file a police misconduct report.</p>
