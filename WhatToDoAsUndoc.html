<h1>Brief Information for Undocumented People</h1>
<h2><font color="black">What can you, as an undocumented individual, do to protect yourself from ICE?</h2>
<h3><font color="white">If ICE comes to your door</h3>
<p>
Do not open the door: ICE cannot come in without a signed warrant by a criminal court judge. They can only come in if you let them.
<p>
<h3>Remain silent</h3>
<p>
ICE can use anything you say against you in your immigration case so claim your right to remain silent. (Say I plead the fifth amendment and choose to remain silent.)
<p>
<h3>Do not sign</h3>
<p>
Do not sign anything ICE gives you without talking to an attorney.
<p>
<h3>Report and record</h3>
<p>
Report immediately: UWD hotline 1-844-363-1423. Take pictures and videos unless you are on federal government property. Take notes of badge numbers, number of agents, time, type of car and exactly what happened!
<p>
<h3>Fight back</h3>
<p>
Get a trustworthy attorney and explore all options to fight your case. If detained, you may be able to bail - do not give up hope! Join your local team to defend yourself from enforcement!
